        NOTES
            Simple Browser is designed for browsing within the current workspace DbArea.
            It is order-aware and expression/predicate aware.

        PURPOSE
            Advanced browser/workhorse for relational + expression-aware browsing across backends.

        SYNTAX
            SMARTBROWSER [<source>] [FOR <expr>] [ORDER <tag>|PHYSICAL]

        OPTIONS / SUBCOMMANDS
            <source>             Optional source (DbArea/workspace, SQLite3, or schema engine where available).
            FOR <expr>           Apply an expression filter using the predicate pipeline.
            ORDER <tag>|PHYSICAL Set controlling order/tag when browsing DbArea-backed sources.

        EXAMPLES
            SMARTBROWSER
            SM FOR gpa >= 3.5
            SMART ORDER LNAME

        NOTES
            Smart Browser is the flagship browser. It can operate with DbArea/workspaces and,
            when configured, can also operate with SQLite3 and schema-driven sources.
