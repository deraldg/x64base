R"(DotTalk++ Educational Reference

Purpose
    EDREF is the instructional help catalog for learning DotTalk++ as a system.

What belongs here
    - programming concepts shown by DotScript and command flow
    - data concepts such as tables, records, fields, indexes, and relations
    - engine concepts such as metadata, tuple projection, ordering, buffering
    - practical examples written in the style of DotTalk++ commands

What does not belong here
    - FoxPro compatibility syntax reference itself
    - raw command catalog material already kept in foxref.hpp / dotref.hpp

Teaching approach
    This file explains the system in plain language.
    It is meant to answer:
        "What is this feature for?"
        "How do I think about it?"
        "What is the simplest example?"
        "How does it relate to the larger engine?" )",

R"(How to think about DotTalk++

DotTalk++ is best understood as four layers working together:

1. Command Layer
    The CLI accepts commands such as:
        USE
        SELECT
        LIST
        SET ORDER
        SET RELATION
        REL ENUM

2. Data Layer
    The engine works with:
        tables
        records
        fields
        indexes
        relations

3. Logic Layer
    DotScript and command execution provide:
        sequential flow
        decision flow
        looping flow
        expression evaluation

4. View / Projection Layer
    Results are shown through:
        LIST
        DISPLAY
        TUPLE
        SMARTLIST
        REL ENUM
        browser commands

A practical mental model
    Table       = stored rows
    Record      = one row
    Field       = one column value in a row
    Index       = alternate ordered path through rows
    Relation    = parent-child path between tables
    Tuple       = projected logical row, possibly across multiple tables )",

R"(Programming Construct 1: Sequential Flow

Definition
    Sequential flow means commands run one after another in the order written.

Why it matters
    Most DotTalk++ scripts are fundamentally sequential.
    The result of one step prepares the next step.

Example
    WORKSPACE OPEN DBF
    SELECT STUDENTS
    SET INDEX TO students.cdx
    SET ORDER TO TAG LNAME
    LIST 5

What happens
    1. Open tables
    2. Select STUDENTS
    3. Attach the container
    4. Activate the LNAME order
    5. Print rows

Teaching point
    In sequential flow, state accumulates.
    Later commands depend on earlier commands.

Common mistake
    Forgetting that SELECT changes the active work area before the next command runs.)",

Definition
    Decision flow chooses between alternatives based on a condition.

Current DotTalk++ form
    IF <expr>

    ELSE

    ENDIF

Concept
    IF asks a yes/no question.
    If true, the IF branch runs.
    Otherwise, the ELSE branch runs, if present.

Example
    IF GPA > 3.5
        ECHO HONOR STUDENT
    ELSE
        ECHO REGULAR STUDENT
    ENDIF

Educational importance
    This is how a script becomes selective instead of merely linear.

Typical uses

    - guard a destructive operation
    - separate normal and exceptional paths

Teaching point

Definition
    A loop repeats work.

DotTalk++ loop families
    LOOP ... ENDLOOP
    WHILE ... ENDWHILE
    UNTIL ... ENDUNTIL
    SCAN ... ENDSCAN

1. LOOP
    Repeats a fixed number of times.

    Example
        LOOP 3 TIMES
            ECHO HELLO
        ENDLOOP

2. WHILE
    Repeats while a condition stays true.

    Example concept
        WHILE counter < 10
            ...
        ENDWHILE

3. UNTIL
    Repeats until a condition becomes true.

4. SCAN
    Record-oriented loop over table rows.

    Example
        SCAN
            TUPLE *

Teaching point

What SCAN is
    SCAN is not just a general loop.
    It is a record-processing loop tied to the current work area.

What it does

    respecting the current order and, where applicable, filtering behavior.

Example
    SELECT BUILDING
    SCAN

What students should learn
    - SCAN is the database equivalent of "for each row"
    - SCAN makes table traversal explicit
    - SCAN is usually more educational than hiding iteration inside a command

Related idea

Definition
    State means the current internal condition of the session.

    - active filter
    - relation graph

Why it matters
    Commands do not operate in a vacuum.
    They operate against the current state.

Example

Here SEEK depends on:

Commands related to schema and live state

Compatibility notes
